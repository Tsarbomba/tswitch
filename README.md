# TSwitch
TSwitch - a Twitch.tv &amp; Livestreamer Frontend client
 
TSwitch or TwitchSwitch is a [Twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/) &  [Livestreamer](http://docs.livestreamer.io/) frontend client. It includes functionality to quickly switch between Twitch.tv streams as well as chat. The software is written in Java 8 and depends on [Livestreamer](http://docs.livestreamer.io/) being installed in order to work.

The current version(BETA) has been developed on a Windows 7 platform. However it should run just fine on Linux as well.

<b>HOWTO:</b><br>

TSwitch BETA 2 requires at least Java 8u40 since it uses JavaFX Dialogs. The old BETA 1 client uses Swing and should work with any Java 8 version.

<ol><li>Install/Update to latest <a href='https://www.java.com/'>Java</a> 
</li><li>Install the latest version of <a href='http://docs.livestreamer.io/'>Livestreamer</a></li></ol>

<b>DOWNLOAD:</b><br> Get latest BETA 2 build <a href='https://github.com/Tsarbomba/tswitch/raw/master/TwitchSwitch/build/TSwitch-FX.jar'>here</a>.<br>Alternatively get the discontinued Swing BETA 1 client incl. src<a href='https://github.com/Tsarbomba/tswitch/raw/master/TwitchSwitch/build/TSwitch-BETA1-Swing.rar'> here</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>TROUBLESHOOTING:</b><br>
If no video loads when you press the Watch button on a live stream, make sure you have livestreamer installed and in your PATH. To check that you do, open a cmd window and type "livestreamer twitch.tv/ChannelName" without quotes and ChannelName replaced with an actual twitch.tv channel name.<br>
