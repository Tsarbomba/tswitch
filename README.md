# TSwitch
TSwitch - a Twitch.tv &amp; Livestreamer Frontend client
 
TSwitch or TwitchSwitch is a [Twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/) &  [Livestreamer](http://docs.livestreamer.io/) frontend client. It includes functionality to quickly switch between Twitch.tv streams as well as chat. The software is written in Java 8 and depends on [Livestreamer](http://docs.livestreamer.io/) being installed in order to work.

The current version(BETA) has been developed on a Windows 7 platform. However it should run just fine on Linux as well.

<b>HOWTO:</b><br>

TSwitch BETA 2 requires at least Java 8u40 since it uses JavaFX Dialogs. The old BETA 1 client uses Swing and should work with any Java version.

</li><li>Install the latest version of <a href='http://docs.livestreamer.io/'>Livestreamer</a></li></ol>
